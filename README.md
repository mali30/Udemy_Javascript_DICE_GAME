This is JavaScript game from the Complete Javascript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

This is a 2 player game. The rules are simple. A random number is generated everytime you roll the dice. You keep rolling until you reach a 100 points. Any time that you roll
a 1, you must start over. You can click the hold button which will add on whatever points you get from rolling the dice to your global score. Good luck
